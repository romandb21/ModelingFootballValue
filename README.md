# ENSAE Programming Project 2024: Modeling Football Player Value  

## Description  
This project, **Modeling Football Player Value**, aims to statistically estimate the value of football players based on their sports performance. The goal is to develop a reproducible data science pipeline that leverages open data sources, web scraping, or APIs to gather player data and compare the results with reference values from platforms like Transfermarkt or the CIES.  

This project was developed as part of the programming course for second-year students at ENSAE Paris.  

## Main Features  
- **Data Collection and Enrichment**:  
  - Use of open datasets, scraping, and APIs to gather detailed player performance metrics.  
  - Cleaning, transforming, and enriching data for analysis.  
- **Data Visualization**:  
  - Creation of insightful plots and dashboards to explore trends and relationships.  
- **Player Value Estimation Models**:  
  - Implementation of various machine learning algorithms to predict player market values.  
  - Comparison of model outputs with reference values (Transfermarkt, CIES).  
- **Reproducible Research**:  
  - Complete pipeline, from data acquisition to analysis, documented and shared on GitHub.  
  - Unit tests to ensure the reliability of core functions.
